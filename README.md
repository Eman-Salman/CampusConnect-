ðŸ’¡ **Tips:**  
- Replace the `![Home Screen]` and `![Events Screen]` links with actual screenshots if you want it to look extra professional.  
- You can add badges at the top like React Native version, Expo SDK, or license.  

If you want, I can make a **version with badges included** so it looks super polished and professional. Want me to do that?
